	\section{User Feedback}
	The user feedback recieved described in this section will inform the on the final designs on in the next section.
	A series of questions were sent out and users asked to respond on these based on the designs about, below are the results.

	As observed from the results above we can see that the primary concerns are mostly covered by our current design but the addition of a "nearby locations" would help increase the user experience.
	Conversely we can see that the decision to not include a profile function in the early prototyping was useful as some respondents raised concerns with data collection.
	However a number of the core features, such as the rating and the photos
