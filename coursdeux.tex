	\section{User Feedback}
	The user feedback recieved described in this section will inform the on the designs reviewed in the next section.
	A series of questions were sent out and users asked to respond on these, below are the results.
\begin{table}[H]
\hspace{-3cm}
\begin{tabular}{lllcp{3cm}llc}
\hline
	name & age & occupation & native & question1 & question2 & question3 & question4 \\
\hline
	Adam & 21 & Student & Yes & Check for transport availability & Yes & Yes & None \\
	Liam & 22 & Student & Yes & Opening times of venue & Yes & No & Have to sign up \\
	Steve & 45 & Mechanic & No & Access by public transport & No & No & Internet Acess \\
	Anne & 24 & Researcher & No & Public Transport access and opening times & No & Yes & the past locations \\
	Luke & 22 & Software Engineer & Yes & Ability to filter by distance, opening times & Yes & Yes & None \\
	James & 20 & Barista & No & Filter by cost/opening times & Yes & Yes & None \\
	Alice & 23 & Developer & No & Only see highly rated locations & Yes & Yes & None \\
	John & 31 & Carpenter & No & Link to the pages website, pictures of the place, make bookings for tours & No & Yes & Tracking of any kind \\
	Bill & 29 & IT & Yes & If the place has food onsite, if not nearby locations & Yes & Yes & None \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
	As observed from the results above we can see that the primary concerns are mostly in the core functionality previously discussed but the addition of a "nearby locations" would help increase the user experience.
	Conversely we can see that the decision to not include a profile function in the early prototyping was useful as some respondents raised concerns with data collection.
	However a number of the core features, such as the rating and the photo adding will require this feature.

\section{CogTool}
To determine if the additions to design one made in design two negatively or positively affected the use of the application to perform a given task, CogTool was employed.
The previously shown pages were imported as frames and links drawn over to simulate the clickable areas.
Three tasks were chosen in order to give a good overview of the uses of the app and "Think" times were added were appropriate to simulate the use case of a first time user.
These three tasks were carried on on both designs with the same delays applied where appropriate and both designs began in the same place, the homepage.
